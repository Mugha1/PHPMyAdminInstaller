## before installing it - think about it


Before you install PHPMyAdmin on your system, think twice about it:

  - PHPMyAdmin is exposing your Database on a publically available website - just behind a username and password
  - There are a lot of known [exploits](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-784/Phpmyadmin.html)
  - and there are [exploits](https://snyk.io/vuln/composer:phpmyadmin%2Fphpmyadmin), which are known, but not fixed

## This is what you should use:

 Here are some clients out there, which give you access to your database, without exposing it through a website:

 - [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) _(it is written in Java, so you can run it nearly everywhere)_
 - [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip) _(available on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X)_
 - [mysql workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)  _(available on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X)_

 If you use one of these clients, I would recommend using an SSH tunnel, that you don't have to expose the MySQL Port to the outside world
